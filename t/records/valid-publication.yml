  text: Glutathione peroxidases (Gpxs) are antioxidant enzymes not studied so far
    in legume nodules, despite the fact that reactive oxygen species are produced
    at different steps of the symbiosis. The function of two Gpxs that are highly
    expressed in nodules of the model legume Lotus japonicus was examined. Gene expression
    analysis, enzymatic and nitrosylation assays, yeast cell complementation, in situ
    mRNA hybridization, immunoelectron microscopy, and LjGpx-green fluorescent protein
    (GFP) fusions were used to characterize the enzymes and to localize each transcript
    and isoform in nodules. The LjGpx1 and LjGpx3 genes encode thioredoxin-dependent
    phospholipid hydroperoxidases and are differentially regulated in response to
    nitric oxide (NO) and hormones. LjGpx1 and LjGpx3 are nitrosylated in vitro or
    in plants treated with S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Consistent with the modification
    of the peroxidatic cysteine of LjGpx3, in vitro assays demonstrated that this
    modification results in enzyme inhibition. The enzymes are highly expressed in
    the infected zone, but the LjGpx3 mRNA is also detected in the cortex and vascular
    bundles. LjGpx1 is localized to the plastids and nuclei, and LjGpx3 to the cytosol
    and endoplasmic reticulum. Based on yeast complementation experiments, both enzymes
    protect against oxidative stress, salt stress, and membrane damage. It is concluded
    that both LjGpxs perform major antioxidative functions in nodules, preventing
    lipid peroxidation and other oxidative processes at different subcellular sites
    of vascular and infected cells. The enzymes are probably involved in hormone and
    NO signalling, and may be regulated through nitrosylation of the peroxidatic cysteine
    essential for catalytic function.
